# demo_website_CMS_MSAccess
Homemade CMS used to populate content for my demo web development website

## About this project
This is a simple, homemade CMS built in MS Access to manage content for my demo website.

It was created as a practical learning exercise and to support dynamic content updates.
I have a great love of MS Access so this was an obvious choice for me,
at some point I'd like to rebuild this functionality in something more modern.
